# # initial planning value for context variables
# init:

# # list of all context variables which are independent for each robot
# # (need to be mentioned at init)
# independent:
#   - battery


# # function(g,b)
# # g - good
# # b - bad
# # return True if g is better than b
# compare:
#     battery: g > b


# # function(v,c)
# # v - value
# # c - cost
# # reflect implicit cost dependency of v
# # return new value of v modified based on c
# cost:
#     battery: v - 1*c


# # context variables solely calculated from other context variables
# derived:
#     battery_empty: battery <= 0
